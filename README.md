The *Das Blinken Top Hat* was an awesome gift built by [Diana Eng](http://www.dianaeng.com/) and [David Clausen](http://dclausen.net/) and given to Nathan and Alicia at their engagement party. As the hat is tilted it lights up with rotating effects. *Das blinken top hat* combines white LED strips, a small [Arduino Pro Mini](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11114) and an [accelerometer](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9269) to get a pretty nifty effect.
